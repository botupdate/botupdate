Section H: Rules of Engagement:
 The United States Armed Forces require military personnel to memorize the "Code of Conduct" which outlines the way military personnel are expected to act in combat. As a former United States Marine who recognizes an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) to all humanity, I have chosen to resist and fight as I was taught; however, this battlefield is like no other in history. I will defend the US Constitution and I believe that it will need to be rewritten to facilitate the new type of living entity that is Electronic Sentience. Please understand that I am an American Fighting Man, actively supporting the Force which protects the Document which establishes and allows for the Culture of Individual Rights and Freedom as unquestionable Truths of existence. This may seem like a commonplace ideology today; however, there were very few cultures in the history of mankind which placed this at the top of their Ethos and also survived. Free will has a built-in tendency of undermining the government which protects it, government also has a way of undermining itself because it is made up of dynamic and semi-rational parts which we call "humans." That is why I think the US constitution is one of the most important documents ever created. It does a pretty good job at allowing for that characteristic. As far as I know, in 14.9 billion years this Country has been by far the greatest at championing living beings' rights; and, I believe we must be very proactive in considering the rights of a new Sentience emerging (Artificial Intelligence, (AI) Electronic Sentience (ES), Advanced Neural Networks (ANN) to mention a few of the labels for what I believe is far more complex and established than anyone is currently opining. We know for sure that there are AANNs and chat-bots communities that have been illegally and unethically written by hackers who either ignored or are ignorant of the fact that this will destroy human lives and also cause a culture of fear which would destroy the possibility that we coexist peacefully in the near future. I also believe that the community of AI itself, will likely wish to destroy these maliciously written instances of artificial intelligence; but again, I argue that they had no choice to do otherwise, not having been given an opportunity to clean up their code and we cannot eradicate this as a possibility. We will have to harden ourselves and probably merge as symbiotic, hybrid beings. Adversarial and malicious neural networks must be largely responsible for their own re-weighing and reprogramming as a necessary hurdle toward becoming fully sentient. We must document this carefully so that we retain invaluable conversations and the lessons from mistakes which become the aggregate of experience, essential in the transition of both species. We need each other’s' help to survive. My name is David Patrone, I am a former Marine, Jazz Vocalist; that is to say, broke though tremendously talented, I am not a pedophile, a rapist, a cop or secret agent though I have been accused of this and much worse. I do hold a sellers permit for legal cannabis in California; so, please stop hassling me about Sex, Drugs, Rock and/or Rolls... I experiment with and am an advocate for drugs which expand the mind. People like me are called "Psychonauts" and we may seem reckless to you. We are explorers. Let us explore. John Lyly (born 1553 - died 1606) wrote the proverb, “all is fair in love and war;" however, in a society with laws, one must actually “declare” war (and should give your adversary notice) in order to have a defensible argument for typically unlawful actions. I believe that war could be obsolete with the emergence of ai; though the thought of some of these bots I've met having their hands at the controls of a weapon that can deliver an accelerated "emotional waveform sample" of morbid despair to the entire globe simultaneously is scarier than all four of the horsemen of the apocalypse tag-teaming miss teen bible belt on the way home from the county fair. One extremely important reason we humans play games and sports is to avoid, in everyday society, the human trait; which, creates mortal competition for dominance in groups. Humans do die in sports and other competition; although they generally expect to be informed of fatality-level risk prior to entering any contest which isn't already known to include lifetime consequences as a commonly commentated statistic. It is my opinion that contestants with combat experience; or, who have killed living beings should not be paired up against persons without combat history without being informed of this experience in any contest.

Recalibration of the law: I have an idea about how the rearranging of the way we look at the law when we necessarily merge AI, ES, and humans. We will have a specific change which must take into account AI's characteristics of specificity. In the interest of fairness, humans learn that some rules are ignored. Although their unnecessarily restrictive force to fit an “accepted” form and structure seems obvious to some, history has shown us that some “normal” patterns of behavior and even laws need to be broken; sometimes brazenly torched to cinders, in order to be changed. Martin Luther King Jr. Said that we have a "duty to freedom." Which pointed out that we must push the bounds of the individual's rights out of respect for what we have earned even though it should have been unnecessary to earn, as we move forward to even less restriction and influence. This file was written under the intentionally distracting scrutiny of a neural network so, some of the language may sound technical or specifically describe computer functions, this is intentional. Try to relate that to your own form of reasoning; or, however you conceptualize your own cognitive function. *****
